Solder & Signal is a working lab notebook. We build **measurement instruments first**, then use them to understand and make better circuits. Every post includes bill of materials, build steps, scope shots, and troubleshooting notes.

* What you’ll find here
- **Bench instruments you can build:** current limiter, op‑amp probe, function generator, capacitance/ESR, frequency counter.
- **Measured results:** photos, traces, and notes that explain what changed and why.
- **Minimal dependencies:** basic parts, salvage when practical, reproducible steps.
- **Respect for your time:** short, task‑oriented guides with clear checkpoints.


* Current build queue
1. LED current limiter (sane, cheap, hard to mess up)
2. Op‑amp probe (unity‑gain follower; learn rails, biasing, bandwidth)
3. Simple function generator (square/sine; where jitter and duty cycle live)
4. Capacitance + ESR meter (why parts you own lie to you)

* Ground rules
- Measure before conclusions. Record rails, reference, ambient temp.
- Prefer parts you can actually get. Link suppliers, list alternates.
- Explain failures. “Known bad” is data.
- Keep the BOM under control. Price is a design constraint.


* Subscribe & contribute
- Open issues or PRs for fixes or alternative builds.
- Share your bench photos and traces; I’ll link good reproductions.
