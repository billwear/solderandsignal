      <h2>What this project is about</h2>
      <p>A modern breadboard (aka, "solderless breadboard") is a special board with connections 0.1 inch apart (the distance betwen chip pins) and horizontal busbars linking the connections underneath.  The idea is that you can insert your component leads to make a circuit without having to etch a printed circuit board, and without have to solder a bunch of test components together.  Here's a picture of a typical breadboard with a test circuit installed:</p>

      <p>Breadboards are nice, but they can be <em>very</em> expensive.  But let's ask one very obvious question: why are they called <em>bread</em>boards? Well, the answer will tell us everything we need to know about how to make our own, without spending a lot of money.</p>
      <h2>The origin of the breadboard (maybe)</h2>
      <p>Again, we start with a board.  Wood is relatively non-conductive, especially for the kind of voltages you'll encounter in electronics.  It makes a naturally-insulated platform.  And what kind of small boards were readily available at little cost?  Well, bread boards, of course.  You can pick up some of the history at <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/breadboards-for-beginners/whats-up-with-the-name">adafruit</a> (an excellent place to get components and supplies at reasonable prices, by the way).</p>
      <p>In the next few days, we're going to make an old-fashioned breadboard, using just stuff I can find around the farm.  I already 1.25 inch finishing nails, and there's wire all over the place out here, ripped out of previous installations and saved.</p>
      <p>Side-note: the farmhouse where I live was built by Birdie and Robert Stewart -- my wife's grandparents -- back in 1957.  Along the way, lots of wire of various types and sizes was installed, de-installed, and then left around wherever it fell.  Your typical third-hand owner would just throw all that stuff out, but we have a motto for Birdie's Far, or as we call it, "Birdie's Next:" <strong>Save everything.</strong>  You new know where  you may be able to use something.</p>
      <p>So anyway, keep watch: we'll be building a DIY breadboard in the coming days.</p>
