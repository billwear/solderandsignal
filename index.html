      Hello, world!
    </h1>
    <p>My name is Bill Wear, and I live in the southern United States. I am an Electrical Engineer by training.</p>  

<p>I have some experience with a Canonical product called MAAS for which I'm going to share some walkthroughs and tutorials.</p>  

<p>I also build kits (like the Altair 8800 that's sitting in my closet), as well as basic circuits from breadboard to PCB.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>
