      <h1>Hi, There</h1>
      <p>Welcome to <em><strong>Solder & Signal</em></strong>, dedicated to the electronics and radio hobbyist in all of us.</p>

      <p>Here, I plan to spin up an ongoing chain of electronics projects, infused with encouragement and driven by the conviction that anyone can enjoy building their own circuits, even in an age of consumer micro-electronics.</p>

      <p>In the process, I'd also like to help you build your confidence and self-esteem by achieving things that may have seemed unlikely to you.  And in the process, encourage you to connect with others of similar interests and form real friendships with people of like minds.</p>

      <p>Just getting started.  Stay tuned.</p>
