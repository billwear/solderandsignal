      <h1>On the Air, Five by Five</h1>
      <p>Welcome to <em><strong>Solder & Signal</em></strong>, dedicated to the electronics and radio hobbyist in all of us.</p>

      <p>Here, I’m launching a series of electronics projects, built to encourage hands-on circuit building in a world of ready-made tech. Even modest achievements can increase self-confidence, and hobbies can open horizons and foster new friendships.</p>

      <h2>Bread, Butter and Friends</h2>
      <p>I'm doing this because -- at 66 years old -- I need a pathway to a meaningful, stable, and affordable retirement. There are many hobbies, side-jobs, and avocations that could provide "stable and affordable" results.  I chose teaching electronics because both the subject (electronics) and the activity (teaching) are meaningful to me.  I'll do my very best to help reveal this domain a little at a time, on a budget, using whatever's available around the house.</p>

      <h2>Responsible Hobbies</h2>
      <p>A hobby is a free-time activity by definition. Other responsibilities need to be met first, and this isn't always easy.  The best way to advance a hobby is to schedule it alongside other down-time.  For example, rather than watching TV for three hours in the evening, watch for <em>two</em> and practice electronics for <em>one</em>.  Whenever chores and responsibilities are reasonably met for the day -- the dishes and homework are done, the bills are paid on time, the friends are caught up -- there's a choice to be made: relax until you fall asleep, or set aside some time to be creative.  It should never be any other way.</p> 

      <h2>Theory and Practice</h2>
      <p>The right time to read the book is once before starting, again while building, and once again when confusion sets in about what was just built. "A-ha" moments happen most often with that approach.  The right time to build is before you think you’re ready.  Circuits get miswired, fuses get blown, but with every surprise, there's an moment of discovery: “Oh. Ohhhh. That’s what that meant.”  Those are the most important moments in this hobby.</p>

      <h2>How This Site is Organized</h2>
      <p>There are three links at the top left of your screen: <em>Home</em>, <em>Projects</em>, and <em>Journal</em>.  This is the Home page.  The Projects page is a catalog of electronics hobby projects, starting with simple builds and moving toward more complex circuits; over time, it will branch as more and more projects get added.  The Journal page is just a collection of observations about electronics, hobbies, and life in general, but focused on tips, tricks, and traps that come in handy for the circuit enthusiast.</p>

      <p>Not much else to say here, except good luck, and remember to be careful with that soldering iron.</p>
