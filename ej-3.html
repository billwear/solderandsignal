      <hr/> <h1>The Art of Showing Up</h1

    <p><strong>You don’t need brilliance to build a life that matters. You just need to keep showing up.</strong><br>
    Not in a bumper-sticker, hustle-culture kind of way. I mean the quiet, stubborn act of facing the day when everything in you whispers, “What’s the point?”</p>

    <p>I mean showing up when you’re tired. When you’re ashamed. When the world has stopped clapping, and the only thing keeping you going is the smallest thread of will.</p>

    <p><strong>Because here’s what I’ve learned — again and again:<br>
    Persistence prevails where all else fails.</strong></p>

    <p>You can stack the odds against it. You can underestimate it. But it outlasts them all.</p>

    <hr>

    <p><strong>I’m not the only proof. Look around.</strong></p>

    <p>Thomas Edison tried thousands of times to make a working lightbulb. When asked why he kept failing, he said, “I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.”</p>

    <p>Glenn Cunningham was told he'd never walk again after being burned in a schoolhouse fire. He not only walked — he ran. And became the fastest miler in the world.</p>

    <p>J.K. Rowling was rejected by a dozen publishers before a small press took a chance on her book about a boy wizard.</p>

    <p>Stephen King threw <em>Carrie</em> in the trash. His wife fished it out.</p>

    <p>These people weren’t just talented. They were relentless. They showed up when it looked hopeless.
    When they were broke, broken, or burned out. And they kept showing up until it wasn’t hopeless anymore.</p>

    <p>There’s an old truth in creative circles — especially in places as brutal as Hollywood — that if you have two of three things, you’ll probably make it: talent, luck, and persistence.</p>

    <p><strong>But if you only have one, let it be persistence.<br>
    Because that’s the one that makes the other two matter.</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <p><strong>I’ve tasted that truth in my own life.</strong></p>

    <p>I learned to read at four. Devoured books while other kids were still sounding out syllables.
    In first grade, I finished my work too fast and got sent to the library to keep me occupied.
    My parents moved us to a harder school system just to keep me challenged.</p>

    <p>By high school, I had perfect grades, top test scores, and scholarship offers from places like SMU and Johns Hopkins.</p>

    <p>But I didn’t take them.</p>

    <p>My father — practical, worried about money — said no. So I stayed close to home. And a part of me quietly folded its wings.</p>

    <p>I spent twelve years clawing my way through a degree at UAH. No glory. No straight line. Just showing up.
    And somewhere in all that repetition, I discovered my core truth: <strong>I don’t quit.</strong></p>

    <p>I remember one organic chemistry test — infamous professor, impossible material.
    No one had ever scored a perfect grade. But I read the book. Over and over.
    I worked every problem until they didn’t scare me anymore. I studied the notes forward and backward.</p>

    <p>I didn’t breeze through it — I <em>ground</em> through it.<br>
    And I made a 100. The first one ever. Not because I was brilliant. Because I refused to stop. Because I just kept showing up.</p>

    <hr>

    <p><strong>I’ve shown up for a life that didn’t always love me back.</strong></p>

    <p>At fifteen, my little sister died of leukemia. She was six.</p>

    <p>At the funeral, everyone wept. I didn’t. Not because I didn’t care — but because I didn’t know how to feel what I was supposed to feel. But I stood there. Numb. Present.</p>

    <p>And something inside me learned: even when you don’t understand the pain, you can still show up.</p>

    <p>That same thread carried me through:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Draining relationships, where I was seen more as a provider than a friend.</li>
        <li>Jobs where I was unsure, unseen, uncertain.</li>
        <li>Decades of underachievement and underuse, punctuated by moments of hard-won growth.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now in my sixties, I’m building again: Learning electronics and sharing the lessons.
    Writing documentation. Rebuilding my Emacs system from scratch.
    Drafting essays, pushing through a performance plan, and launching a project that might just carry me forward into the next chapter.</p>

    <p>Some days I feel like I’m starting too late. But I start anyway.</p>

    <p>Because what keeps me alive isn’t brilliance. It’s the willingness to keep showing up.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Most people think success is about raw intelligence, or charisma, or timing.
    But I’ve seen all those things fail.</p>

    <p>The ones who make it — the ones who truly build something rare and valuable — are the ones who show up when it’s hard.
    Who get back up when it feels useless. Who keep moving when no one’s watching.</p>

    <p>So if you feel behind right now… if your life isn’t going the way you imagined…
    If you’re carrying shame or fatigue or a thousand regrets…</p>

    <p><strong>Let me tell you something:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>You’re not broken.<br>
    You’re persistent.</strong></p>

    <p>And that’s enough.<br>
    That’s the power they never tell you about.</p>

    <p>So show up.<br>
    Tired. Late. Unready.<br>
    But show up.</p>

    <p><strong>Because persistence doesn’t need to impress.<br>
    It just needs to endure.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>And when everything else fails — it still wins.</strong></p>
