      <h1>The Electronics Bench</h1>
      <p>I'm not one to push for expensive tools, fancy gadgets, or store-bought setups.  You can use them if you'd like, but they aren't necessary to have a meaningful learning experience or a thriving electronics hobby.  What you do need, though, is a stable place to work.</p>
      <p>It might be the kitchen table, with a thick piece of wood or a silicone mat to protect Mom's finish.  It might be a slab of plywood sitting on two 55-gallon drums or concrete blocks.  It might be your desk or table in a corner of your bedroom.  Wherever you can find a space -- regardless of whether you have to put things away between sessions, or you can just leave the kit out -- you will need a space.</p>
      <h2>Substance Over Style</h2>
      <p>You want to be able to work comfortably, without being too cramped or putting the cat in danger.  For this, you'll need some kind of a surface.  Mine is my desk in my bedroom/office.  It's 60" x 36", and 30" high.  It's basically a standard kitchen table.</p>
      <p>One of these days I might build one of those workstation tables, with a stool, and shelves, and parts bins, and all that.  Given that I'm 66 years old, I might never get around to that.  Let me show you how keep my setup simple without compromising on my ability to work.</p>
      <h3>Simple Storage</h3>
      <p>My storage is currently two 10x12 plastic drawer stacks, with the contents just written on the drawer handle with a magic marker, like these:</p>
      <div class="content-wrap">
	<img src="images/budget-bench.jpg" alt="budget bench" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
	<div class="text">
	  <p><em>This is my budget bench.  It actually used to be smaller, but have a lot more little tiny drawers.</em></p>
	</div>
      </div>
      <p>When we lived in a tiny home, I had little tiny drawers for everything.  When we bought this farm, and a much bigger house, suddenly we had lots of furniture and decorations, and three bedrooms.  Since I didn't want to take over the place, I actually downsized a bit.  Never been sorry, never been an issue.</p>
      <p>You'll see I have a tool drawer; an "active project" drawer; and the four others you can't see in this photo are "components,", "wires & connectors," "computing & circuits" (NUCs, Raspberry PIs, SDR boards), and one miscellaneous one that isn't marked.  It has solder, little project boxes, batteries, and other odds and ends.  It isn't labeled because, well, I couldn't think of a good label for it, and that's perfectly okay.</p>
      <p>You'll also note that I did <em>not</em> scrimp on a soldering station.  With radio electronics, the quality of the solder joint directly affects the quality of the signal.  But it was several years before I actually <em>needed</em> this kind of fine temperature control, so don't feel like you have to start with a top-end item.</p>
      <h3>Storing Components</h3>
      <p>Like I mentioned already, years ago I had a giant, snap-together connection of little drawers.  My desk was super-tiny (it fit into an alcove beside a closet).  I bought a big stack of little tiny drawers, sorted all the components into them by type, value, tolerance, etc., and then spent a lot of time looking for the right part.  It was helpful in the small space, but it could have been so much easier.</p>
      <p>When I moved to the farm, I just grabbed a box of baggies & sorted them that way:</p>
      <div class="content-wrap">
	<img src="images/budget-component-storage.jpg" alt="components sorted by type into plastic sandwich bags" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
	<div class="text">
	  <p><em>I find them so much faster now, because (a) they're all together, and (b) I have to read the labels.</em></p>
	</div>
      </div>
      <p>This helped to revive my skill at reading the values off the components.  This is true for all my components except inductors, which are notoriously badly labeled.  I just keep them in one bag and actually <em>measure</em> their inductance when I need one.  It's much more efficient that way.  Oh, and I buy my components in bulk bags or boxes from whomever's got the best price when I need to resupply.</p>
      <p>So hopefully, you can see that you <em>don't</em> need to spend a fortune on tools, parts, and equipment.  Other than the actual components, you can get by with things you can find at the grocery or drugstore -- or maybe in the junk drawer.</p>
