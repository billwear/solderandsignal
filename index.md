----------------
Solder &amp; Signal is my working lab notebook. I'm planning to build **measurement instruments** first, then use them to understand and make better circuits. 

While the soldering ironâ€™s heating up, let me introduce myself. I'm Bill Wear, an electrical engineer who has been dabbling in circuits and radio for more than 50 years.

I've designed boards and the workstations to test them. I've designed an electronics diagnostic rack for the NASA Space Shuttle program. I've also written micro-code for radiology machines. 

## Getting back to my roots
Lately I've been working as a technical author, but I miss my circuit days, so I'm starting this little subdomain to get back into it. I've been away from it for so long that I want to start from square one.

There's never been a time in my life that I didn't have a shortwave radio around somewhere. Radio and signal craft has always been a meaningful part of my life, either as a job or a hobby. 

So here I go! You're welcome to join me.
