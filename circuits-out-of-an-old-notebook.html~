      <h2>Thoughts on a homemade breadboard</h2>
      <p>At this writing, my next project is a homemade breadboard.  I have a small one that I bought, but those can get expensive (especially with tariffs), so I've been looking for something cheaper.</p>
      <p>I happened across <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Homemade-Breadboard-Using-Paperclips/">this instructable</a>, which suggests a method that uses paperclips, cardboard, and hot glue.  I want to fancy it up some.  For example, I'd like to build spring spirals out of paperclips to hold the components, rather than having to crimp them all the time.  And I'd like for them to be a little more firmly attached.</p>
      <p>Turns out it doesn't work very well.  I put one together on an old paint palette I had.  Doesn't matter whether I use straightened clips or chained ones, I get the same weak voltage response.  In other words, it's really lossy.  I'll have to think of something else, skip to using a storebought one, or just wrap the component leads (the old fashioned way).  More a litte later.</p>
