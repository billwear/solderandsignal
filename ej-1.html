      <h1>Mon Apr 21 09:36:59 PM CDT 2025</h1>
      <p>My first project was a HeathKit digital alarm clock.  Had that clock for almost 20 years.  Can't remember what happened to it.  Woke me up to a loud, electronic "Beeeep! Beeeep! Beeeep!" every morning.  I miss it.</p>
      <p>Six of the seven radios in my home office have an alarm feature, and that includes the phone, which is just a packet radio masquerading as a telephone.  The seventh one is a waterproof, handheld Yaesu ham radio, which has too many other functions to have room for an alarm.</p>
      <p>Fooling around with the medium-sized one a month ago, and got it set to alarm at 7AM and 3PM.  I was taking antibiotics to keep a tooth under control until I could get the root canal.  Didn't find a station, just let it buzz with AC noise and static.  Still got my attention, but tricky to turn off when I was done with it.</p>
      <h2>We All Need Alarm Clocks</h2>
      <p>With the way AI is going today, it might not be long before our radios alarm us with more than just wake-up time.  Imagine a radio that will play some embarrassing music when you start to tell a fib, or blurt out a loud buzz when you start to say a curse word.  Would I carry that radio around with me?  I dunno.</p>
      <p>There are other ways we all need to wake up.  For example, we all need to wake up to our own potential.  It doesn't require a huge skill set to operate a radio, but you can get so much out of it, especially shortwave.  It's even possible to connect RTTY for those who are hearing- or speech-impaired.</p>
      <p>And the skill set to build a radio -- especially from a kit -- isn't much greater.  But the satisfaction of knowing that <em>you did this</em> will stay with you for a lifetime.</p>
      <p>That's just my $.02.</p>
