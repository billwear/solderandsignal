      <p><em><strong>Signal Discipline</strong></em></p>

      <p>Today reminded me of something I keep having to re-learn: Always amplify the signal and suppress the noise.</p>

      <p>It sounds simple — almost too simple. But it’s not.</p>

      <p>I write documentation by day. In the doc world, noise looks like endless restructure debates, internal jargon, or giving every topic equal weight. Signal is what helps someone take the next right step. A power user doesn’t need filler. A first-timer doesn’t need friction.</p>

      <p>Same thing in engineering. The logs are noisy. The network is noisy. The interface between expectations and reality? Noisier still. It takes *discipline* to listen through that — to isolate what's real, what’s useful, and what actually matters.</p>

      <p>Today, I did that twice:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Once when I asked a developer what really breaks when users mess with one of our bundled third-party products, directly — and it turned out we’re exposing a power tool we don’t want them to use.</li>
	<li>And again when I stripped a list of updates down to what actually helped my manager see progress. Not motion. Not noise. <em>Progress</em>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This journal is here to record these little moments of signal clarity. Because the longer you build, the more noise you inherit.  And the real pros? They still choose to listen.</p>
      <p>That's just my $.02.</p>
