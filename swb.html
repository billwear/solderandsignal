      <h2>What this project is about</h2>
      <p>Assuming that you have a reasonably small flat surface in your home, you can build a stable workbench from odds and ends that you can set on top of that flat surface.  This will probably work on your bed, but you'd need to be careful with the soldering iron in that case.  Ideally, this could sit on your kitchen table or on a coffee table, since the workbench itself takes all the abuse.</p>
      <h2>Step one: Get a board for a platform</h2>
      <p>The first piece is just a relatively thin board.  It can be real wood, presswood or old IKEA shelf.  Here's my SWB platform, an old shelf from a DIY bookshelf that survived the demise of its siblings.</p>

      <p>This particular board is 11.5 inches deep, 28.5 inches wide, and around a half ich thick.  This should do fine for attaching small things with small screws, which there are lots of lying around the farm in various places.  This board suits me well, as the RBPS fits nicely on one end: I can clamp it there and it will be out of the way of the circuits, but in reach for powering them.</p>
