 <h1>⚠️ Safety Disclaimer</h1>

  <p><strong>Solder & Signal</strong> is a project-based educational site that explores electronics, signal generation, analog design, and more — often using hand tools, basic components, and occasionally household salvage.</p>

  <p><strong>Solder & Signal</strong> and its owners, publishers, and/or contributors shall not be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from the use or misuse of any content presented on this site.</p>
  
  <h2>Use at Your Own Risk</h2>
  <p>The projects, guides, and suggestions provided here are for educational and informational purposes only. Many of them involve sharp tools, hot soldering irons, potentially dangerous voltages, and other risks. If you choose to build or replicate anything shown here, you do so entirely at your own risk.</p>

  <h2>Know Your Limits</h2>
  <p>Always use caution and proper safety practices when working with electricity or tools. If you're not confident working with AC power, use battery-powered alternatives or seek guidance. Never work alone on circuits involving mains voltage or high current.</p>

  <h2>No Guarantees, No Warranty</h2>
  <p>There is no guarantee that the designs will work as intended, or that they are free of mistakes. There is no warranty, express or implied, that following this material won't result in damage, injury, or frustration. Use common sense and double-check everything.</p>

  <h2>Tools are Dangerous. So is Ignorance.</h2>
  <p>Use the right tools. Use them well. Use your head. Learn as you go — and remember that blowing up a circuit is better than blowing up your fingers.</p>
