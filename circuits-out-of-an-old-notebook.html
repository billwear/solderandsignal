      <h2>Circuits out of an old notebook</h2>
      <p>So I decided to insert some basic electronic circuits in the place of the instruments I plan to build.  We need some experience using the breadboard and turning the results into usable circuits.</p>
      <p>I'm using an old notebook from college, here, pulling out some things that are badly drawn and letting ChatGPT re-imagine them as comprehensible images.  The first one is just a basic potentiometer circuit, like this one:</p>
      <p><center><img src="images/simple-pot-circuit.png" width="100%"></center></p>
      <p>Don't blame the AI for the bad drawing: I just scanned it quickly with my webcam and asked the tool to faithfully reproduce this -- and, well, it did.  My Fritzing skills were very underdeveloped at this point.</p>
      <p><center><img src="images/breadboard-layout.png" width="100%"></center></p>
      <p>So this is my next challange.  Starting on this one as soon as I have time.</p>
